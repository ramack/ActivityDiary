Activity Diary allows to record a diary for your activities. You can attach notes and pictures to the activies and by that record details like the kind of vegetables you seeded while gardening. The diary view provides an overview of what you did and when.
The functions to categorize activites and get a reminder for recurrent actions are planned.
